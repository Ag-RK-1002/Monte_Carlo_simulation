## ðŸ§  Concept Overview

Monte Carlo methods allow us to estimate equilibrium properties of complex systems. The Metropolis algorithm samples from the Boltzmann distribution to accept or reject new states based on energy differences, enabling efficient exploration of configuration space.

### ðŸ”¬ System Highlights

- **Particles**: Classical, interacting in a 1D or 2D box
- **Move proposal**: Random displacement within a range
- **Acceptance criterion**: Based on Boltzmann probability `P = exp(-Î”E / kT)`
- **Observables**: Total energy, configuration distribution
